Attendants - Cesar Barajas, David Luna, Russel Tapia

Goals:
Report 2
- Mostly finished
- add references to any important documantation to avoid plagerism. 

Demo 2
-We want to demonstrate a registration page, a login page, and a menu page in that order.
- register a new user, use new user credentials, and show off the menu.

Coding
- menu, revamp to no longer rely on database for data retrieval. Too labor and computing
intensive
- Registration form, needs to be created and linked to database.

-Page transitions: href
example:
//button that takes you to google
<a href = "www.google.com">
// button html code
</a>

//webpage that includes hyperlink to index
<a href="index.html"> Click here for index </a>
href html
